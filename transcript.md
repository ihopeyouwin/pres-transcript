In this video I’m going to tell about the Mozilla Foundation, its purposes, history, aims, and strategy.
After Establishment the Mozilla Foundation is guided by the Mozilla Manifesto, believes the Internet is a global public resource that must remain open and accessible to all.
The Mozilla Foundation describes itself as "a non-profit organization that promotes openness, innovation and participation on the Internet." 
The Mozilla Foundation is guided by the Mozilla Manifesto, which lists 10 principles which Mozilla believes "are critical 
for the Internet to continue to benefit the public good as well as commercial aspects of life."

4. **History**: 
On a paper The Mozilla Foundation is an organization that exists to support and collectively lead the open source Mozilla project. 
Founded in 2003, the organization sets the policies that govern development, operates key infrastructure and controls Mozilla trademarks . 
It owns a taxable subsidiary: the Mozilla Corporation, which employs many Mozilla developers and coordinates releases of the 
Mozilla Firefox web browser and Mozilla Thunderbird email client, writes the world's most referenced web developer site MDN.
The subsidiary is 100% owned by the parent, and therefore follows the same non-profit principle.
5. **Finances**
The Mozilla Foundation is funded by donations and 2% of annual net revenues from the Mozilla Corporation, amounting to over US$8.3 million in 2016.
Initial funding in 2003 came from AOL, which donated US$2 million.The group has tax-exempt status, though the Mozilla Corporation subsidiary is taxable. 
In 2006, the Mozilla Foundation received US$66.8 million in revenues, of which US$61.5 million is attributed to "search royalties" from Google.
From 2004 to 2014, the foundation had a deal with Google to make Google Search the default in the Firefox browser search bar and hence send it search referrals; 
a Firefox themed Google search site was also made the default home page of Firefox.
Mozilla Corporation functions as a self-sustaining social enterprise – money earned through its products is reinvested into the organization.
6. **Manifesto** 
Moz found work is guided by the Mozilla Manifesto. They are constantly working and reworking  to build the best possible resource for a healthy open internet.

Principle 7 Free and open source software promotes the development of the internet as a public resource.
Principle 8 Transparent community-based processes promote participation, accountability and trust.
Principle 9 Commercial involvement in the development of the internet brings many benefits; a balance between commercial profit and public benefit is critical.
Principle 10 Magnifying the public benefit aspects of the internet is an important goal, worthy of time, attention and commitment.

7. **Internet Health Keyfeatures**
Internet Health
One of the cornerstones of Mozilla’s mission is using the language of “Internet Health” as a way of breaking the larger concept of a representative open web into areas that directly impact people’s lives.
They believe Internet Health impacts people in web in five key areas:
Privacy & Security
The safety and security of the Internet impacts us all. We should be able to understand what is happening to our data, and have the ability to control how it is used.
Openness
“Open” means that anyone can publish or invent online without asking for permission, and that the technologies used to run the Web are transparent and understandable.
Decentralization
Decentralization means the Internet is controlled by many. It’s millions of devices linked together in an open network. No one actor can own it, control it, or switch it off for everyone.
Digital Inclusion
Everyone deserves equal opportunity to access the Internet, and to use it to improve their lives and societies.
Web Literacy
We need everyone to have the skills to read, write and participate in the digital world, so more people can move beyond consuming to actually creating, shaping and defending the Web.
These five key areas are highlighted as ways that touch all internet users lives and as places we can all help, individually as users of the internet and how Mozilla is helping support those steps.

8. **mission and activity** 
Why Mozilla? Resources and mission today
The mission and activity of MF are based on the resources they possess nowadays:
● Not-for-profit status:  moz org is nonprofit org and the sole owner of the Firefox organization. Firefox and Mozilla are trusted global social brands.
● 300 million+ Firefox users across the globe: When needed, we can quickly reach out and mobilize Firefox users to take action based on this trust.

● Social enterprise revenue: Approximately $10 million of Firefox’s annual revenue is invested into the Foundation, providing a solid base to grow a larger movement building fund.    
Moz org strategy and mission: Is to make people  involved in building a healthier digital world, for themselves and their neighbors. Invest in thinking, leaders, and campaigns that
 have a meaningful impact today to influence what the public, companies, and governments will think about the Internet over the next 5 - 10 years.  
The direct work of the Mozilla Foundation focuses on ensuring the internet always remains a global public resource that is healthy, open, and accessible to all. 
They do this by supporting a diverse group of fellows that working on key internet issues that lead us to a more open, inclusive Internet, 
connecting open Internet leaders at events like MozFest, publishing critical research in the Internet Health Report to document and explain 
what’s happening to the wellbeing of the Internet. , and rallying citizens around advocacy issues that connect the wellbeing of the Internet directly to people’s everyday life.
Over time, all these men, that are supported by Mozilla today, will become a deep and powerful global network of people who will weave the idea of Internet health into their careers and their lives.
